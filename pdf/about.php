			<p>An organizational psychologist by formal education, Ian is widely regarded as a
possibility expert. His clients and colleagues frequently refer to and access his uncanny
ability to see game-changing possibilities others don’t see and turn them into profitable
new realities.</p>

<p>Ian's been an entrepreneur since undergraduate days. Initially he focused his
organizational transformation skills on the healthcare sector resulting in a sterling
reputation across his native Canada. Over time, his work expanded into a wide variety of
industries globally including technology companies, government ministries, professional
services, education, manufacturing, finance and insurance, agriculture and retail
operations. Major companies such as KPMG, Royal Bank of Canada and UNIFI
retained his services for multiple years. Year after year he was able to expand their
thinking to see the opportunities all around them.</p>
 <p>Not only is he able to unify people and focus them on
their highest possibilities, he is a gifted corporate speaker
having presented to audiences around the world. This
rare ability led to the honor of being inducted into both
the USA and Canadian Speaker Halls of Fame.
<i>Successful Meetings</i> magazine declared him “One of the
top 21 speakers for the 21st century.”</p>

<p>Ian admits to having low tolerance for inconsequential
incremental change. "There are such enormous
possibilities available to all of us," he insists, "why settle
for less?" As one colleague put it, "Ian is a possibility
magnet!"</p>
<p>He's also written seven books and contributes frequently
to various professional blogs and newsletters.</p>
<p>Ian and his wife Georgia live in Scottsdale, Arizona and
have dual citizenship.<img src="images/about.png" alt="Ian Percy Photo"></p>
