			<p>So where do you stand when it comes to the pursuit of possibilities?  Do you prefer to play it safe, or would you rather go way, way above and beyond the realities of today?  If you wish to ignite far-reaching goals that challenge humdrum habits and change human life for the better, <a href="#contact">Let’s talk.</a> </p>

		<p>Let’s have a conversation about the possibilities you see for your organization, particularly those you’ve never explicitly expressed. Let’s also talk about the readiness of your whole organization for a new way of thinking. </p>

		<p>The problem we ran into with that insurance company? I vowed to never let that happen again.  You don’t want that either, I’m sure. That’s why this initial conversation is so critical to a decision about us working together. </p>

		<p>Although I find it hard to understand, many organizations are determined to maintain the status quo, waiting until an innovation becomes established before they’ll even consider it. I don’t have the patience for that sort of inconsequential change, and I don’t think the world does, either.</p>

		<p>My interest lies with organizations that have the energy, hunger and commitment to lead their sector, to discover and act on their highest possibilities, thereby making themselves unassailable. If that’s your team, I’d be pleased and honored to hear from you.  
			</p>
			
 <h2>What to Expect</h2>
<p>My role is as a <i>Possibility Coach</i>. That involves teaching, facilitating, encouraging, challenging and at times provoking individuals and teams to see and reach just one possibility higher.</p>

<p>Exactly how you go about becoming a possibility-focused organization will be unique to you. Everyone needs to have ownership in the process. That means you and the teams who work with you have to develop the process of possibility thinking from the get-go,
not have some pre-packaged cookie-cutter program imposed on the organization. To do otherwise is to keep people imprisoned in that metaphorical "box" we all want to escape.</p>

<p>Further down in this website are articles that explain the principles behind the concept of possibility thinking; there’s even a little physics thrown in. Some of this will challenge your thinking and, frankly, if that doesn’t happen I will have failed you. If people don’t think differently, they won’t perform differently. It’s that simple. </p>

<p>And now, all things considered, are you ready to have that conversation?  If so, simply email me at <a href="mailto:Ian@IanPercy.com">Ian@IanPercy.com</a> or call <a href="tel:480-502-3898">480-502-3898</a>.  I look forward to exploring possibilities with you.</p>
