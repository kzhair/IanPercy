            <p>	As a leader, you solve problems.  But if that’s all you do, at best all you get for the effort is caught up. For your work to have a lasting impact, you must focus on possibilities.  That way, you are creating the future rather than mending the past. Through possibility thinking, you see energizing options before your competitors do.   You blaze a trail by turning transformative new ideas into profitable realities.</p>
         
<h2 class="section-title">Breakthrough Opportunities Ahead</h2>
        <p>The 2018 Bloomberg Innovation Index states that, for the first time, the USA is no longer among the top 10 innovative countries.  Robert Atkinson, CEO of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, commented, “I see no evidence that this trend will not continue.”</p>
		<p>But that bleak prediction isn’t cast in stone.  With an understanding of the dynamics of possibility thinking, you can envision bold "what-ifs" and lead your organization to bring them to fruition.  Instead of idly wondering what a Bezos, Musk, Jobs or Gates has or had that you don’t, you and your team jumpstart and implement innovations that significantly change the way we all live.
