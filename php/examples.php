<p>This page is meant to show you that I don’t merely talk about discovering possibilities, I’m
actually doing it. To various depths, I’m connected to the examples listed below with the goal of
helping them become significantly disruptive in their market sector.</p>

<p>I won't mind at all if you see some as nonsense or just flat out impossible. That will
confirm that boundaries are being challenged. Truth is if we don’t arouse questions and
doubts, we’re not reaching high enough! There's nothing worse than having attempts at innovation produce a yawn!</p>

<p>Much of my attention has gone to understanding the role of frequencies, energy and vibration.
Since <i>everything</i> is in vibration, the possibilities are endless. Here are some of the results so
far.</p>

<ul>
<li>Changing the resonance of crop irrigation water resulting in huge increases
in yield and quality while reducing water and toxic chemical use.</li>

<li> Concrete was made 12 to 15% stronger just by changing the resonance of the water; no additives involved at all.</li>

<li> Made water much more hydrating for pets and livestock, especially
beneficial for commercial operations.</li>

<li> Used frequencies to make significant improvement to battery
performance while keeping it about 60% cooler.</li>

<li>Conditioning electrical systems in buildings resulting in reduced energy and maintenance cost and a much
healthier environment.</li>

<li>Made cheap wine and spirits taste like the good stuff. Frequencies also accelerate the natural barrel aging process.</li>

<li>Enhanced hydration capability of drinking water by about 30% to solve the huge dehydration problem especially among elderly.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are brilliant people who've seen possibilities in global water
production, plant-based medicinals for a wide range health problems, how
to restore contaminated land around the world, a new way to insulate our
buildings and a semiconductor that will revolutionize computing architecture.</p>

<p>Look, the list is endless. People everywhere are embracing what others see as
“impossible” and are changing our world and how we live in it.
If you look for it, you’ll find the concept of "possibilities" becoming the meme for many
companies. Toyota (<i>Start your impossible</i>), U.S. Bank (<i>Power of Possible</i>), Samsung
(<i>Do what you can't!</i>), the American Petroleum Institute (<i>Power Past Impossible</i>) and AARP (<i>Real Possibilities</i>) are just a few of the
current examples.</p>

<p>Admittedly, some of these tag lines may come from marketing departments rather
than from reality, but they are an important signal that should not be ignored. The
World of Possibilities is the next global battleground. If your organization wants to
win or even hold a position there, possibility thinking is required by the whole
team. As former Apple CEO John Sculley noted: "The future belongs to those
who see possibilities before they become obvious."</p>

<p>The question here is when, where and how will your organization see and embrace
your <i>impossibles</i> and turn them into vital, profitable and game-changing new realities?
If you believe your organization is ready to do so, call me, and let’s have that first
conversation. <a href="mailto:Ian@IanPercy.com">Ian@IanPercy.com</a> or <a href="tel:480-502-3898" title="Call Ian Percy">480-502-3898</a>.
